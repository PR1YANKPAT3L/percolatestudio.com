Our goal is to build value by creating digital products people love using. We are not in the business of trends or one-off campaigns.

2. Our programs last about 3 months (one quarter)
3. The internship is a minimum 40hr/week commitment
3. Interns are provided a weekly stipend
4. Interns get in-person experience with our product process so they must be on location. (We don't offer relocation or visas at this time)

About you
